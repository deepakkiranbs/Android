GoogleConnect Project has integrated Google sign in and the list view of Beards
The MainActivity receives data from Google account. Using a Bundle object and putExtra method of Intent Object the data is passed on to subsequent activities.

Also obtain Unique ID of the account to validate on the server. If Unique ID does not exist add the account to registration daabase. If it already
exists. (Don't add the account)(we are not doing any past orders of a returning customer, so we need not identify whose account it is)

Rectify the UI and use the mail function. GoogleConnect is the starting point
